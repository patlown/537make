Usage:

    '537make' or '537make <target>'

This will only work if you have a valid makefile in the current directory.  A valid makefile follows the format below.

This program will handle a makefile that is formatted as:

<target>: <dependency> <dependency> <dependency> <etc>
    <command>
    <command>
    <command>
    <etc>

All targets will be recursively built by first building their dependencies.  New lines are acceptable between targets and commands.  All commands must start with a tab.

The program will print an error for a line that is formatted incorrectly.

Has three main modules, a module that parses the makefile into structures the program can handle (text_parsing.c/h), a module that builds and tests for correctness a dependency graph
(build_spec_graph.c/h) and a module that iterates through our graph and runs the commands for each target in the correct order (proc_creation_prog_exe.c/h).  These modules allow main to use high
level function calls to execute the makefile.
